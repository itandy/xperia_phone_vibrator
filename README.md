Android Phone Vibrator
===================================

Vibrator your Android phone when an outgoing call is connected and ended

This is a Xposed module so your phone must be rooted to use it. The module is based on AOSP ICS/JB phone app. I tested it using my Sony Xperia ZR phone with 4.2.2 stock ROM.

Installation instructions:
1. Install the module
2. Run Xposed Installer and enable the module Vibrate on connected outgoing call or ended call for Android phones
3. Reboot the phone
